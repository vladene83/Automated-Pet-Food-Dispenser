# Automated-Pet-Food-Dispenser
This project is an automated pet food dispenser developed as part of my bachelor's thesis. It is powered by an ESP32 microcontroller and combines a stepper motor, an ultrasonic sensor, and a 16x2 I2C LCD to create a fully autonomous feeding system. The device connects to a Wi-Fi network and serves a simple local HTML interface where feeding times can be configured or triggered manually. Food levels are monitored using the ultrasonic sensor, and all key information is displayed both on the LCD and through the web interface. The housing and mechanical components are 3D printed, and the system is designed to operate independently once it is set up.
